Zion National Park was the second stop on my Spring Break 2025 Utah trip, right after Bryce Canyon. 
Zion’s massive red cliffs, narrow slot canyons, jagged rocks amidst the fog, and bright blue skies made it one of the most 
incredible places I’ve ever hiked. I could easily see why it’s one of the most visited national parks in the U.S.

<i>Personal note: I enjoyed every single hike I went on those two days I spent in the park. But I will say that hiking through the water in the narrows was unbelievable. The water was really cold but it was so cool seeing the amazing rock structures formed by thousands of years of erosion from the Virgin River.</I>
