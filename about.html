Hello everyone, my name is Jack Mason, and welcome to my website. This website is meant to serve as a collection of my thoughts, works, and experiences. 
          </p>
My thoughts will be written in the form of blog/journal posts, with content ranging from the brieftest of ideas and fleshing-out of said ideas to potentially even stories or essays about content that interests me. 
          <p>
My works relate to the career path that interests me: equity research. I will post both my models and reports for companies I research and I think it will be cool to be able to look back and see the growth in quality and effectiveness of the reports I put out. 
     
          </p>
And finally, my experiences will be in the form of a detailed account of places I have traveled to, pictures I took along the way, and informative excerpts about what makes these places so special. While I have only recently started getting into photography and hiking (1-2 years now), it is one of my absolute favorite pastimes and I will enjoy writing about them and showing everyone my pictures. 
          <p>
I want this site to be relatively minimalist as everything on here I coded myself (with the help of some chatgpt) and more content-focused. I also want to shout out Hudson for inadvertently inspiring me to create a website/blog. I really enjoyed his style and there will definitely be some elements of his site that will be found in mine. <p> Check his out: <a href="https://https://www.grillhudson.com/#/hudson">grillhudson.com</a> </P>
 Anyways thanks for reading this and have a great day!
          </p>
