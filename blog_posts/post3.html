          <p>
I would say my peak cardio was either like 8th grade or 10th grade summer, at 13 and 15/16  years old, respectively. I am now 20 years old and I would hate to think my best is behind me. Back then I played lots of soccer and weighed like 20 lbs less (mostly from muscle but I was fs a bit leaner). After focusing on weight training for the past couple years and with club and high school soccer ending, I’ve really neglected any form of running. Last semester I ran about once a week on average but I wanted to do more. Going into this new year, to keep up consistency, I decided to do the “run-the-date challenge.” Even though I was kinda doing it wrong like for January 2nd I did 1.2 instead of 1.02 mi but whatever. While it's only the 12th and I did my first longer run (10 k) of the year yesterday, I am LOVING my progression. Running every day is not only a great habit for me but I just feel so much better. While each day may not be faster in time/mile, I just feel so much healthier. My breathing has improved so much, and any pain in my shins/calves from impact has really gone away. My long run yesterday felt amazing and while it was hard the first 3.5 miles in, those last 2.8-9 were amazing. I was even able to sprint the last mile and a half-ish and ended up getting under 50 minutes (which is pretty good for me). While it might be unrealistic to genuinely follow the run-the-date challenge (12 miles every day in December is literally insane…) I don’t want to think about it like that. The point of this challenge is to be consistent every day and to improve my cardio at the same time. My goal is to run a marathon this year and by sticking to this challenge with a few long runs every now and then (and no injuries pls) I think I will be able to do that. I will probably be writing about running again one of these weeks as I want to talk about the mental and therapeutic aspect of it in its own post. I just wanted to write about the beginning of this journey and what it means to me.
