Glacier National Park was the place that really sparked my love for national parks. I stopped by here after visiting Montana following the COVID lockdowns. Even though I only got to see a few areas near the water and do small hikes because of heavy snow that winter, the dramatic peaks and icy lakes left a huge impression. I’m looking forward to returning in spring or fall to explore more of the park.

<i>Personal note: Because I visited in winter, most of my time was spent near the lakes and on shorter trails due to snow coverage, but even those limited views convinced me how special national parks can be. I can't wait to come back in a warmer season and hike farther into the backcountry.</i>
